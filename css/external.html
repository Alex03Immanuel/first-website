  <h1 align = "center"> <u> WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY </u> </h1>
  <p> Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.
  <br/>
  In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms,
  to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing .

  <dt> <b> Confidentiality </b> </dt>
  <dd> The information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended.  </dd>

  <dt> <b> Integrity </b> </dt>
  <dd>  The information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended receiver without the alteration being detected. </dd>

  <dt> <b> Phishing / social engineering </b> </dt>
  <dd> Phishing is a form of social engineering that tricks users into providing their own PII or sensitive information. In phishing scams,
       emails or text messages appear to be from a legitimate company asking for sensitive information,such as credit card data or login information. </dd>
  <br/>
  <dt> <b> Authentication </b> </dt>
  <dd> The sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin/destination of the information. </dd>
